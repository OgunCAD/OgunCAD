            <h3>EXISTING ALTERNATIVES</h3>
            The calculation of the cost of production occurs either roughly "by eye" or for a long time. Third-party programs allow only to design products, all calculations (weight, waste, cost of materials, labor costs for manufacturing as any other calculations are done manually). Buying these programs is a long one, since it involves sending a physical security key. In many industries, those maps are drawn manually, and almost all calculations are done in Excel ..

            A web application is developed in compiled programming language, microsoft pays a lot of attention to the security of asp.net. The probability of hacking or decompiling the code is missing or negligible.
            <h3>CHANNELS</h3>
